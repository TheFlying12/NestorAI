Future Plans

- Finish the Ollama model download, then verify Telegram round-trip end-to-end.
- Add a health-check script to validate webhook, gateway, OpenClaw, and Ollama in one pass.
- Add a lightweight test harness for webhook payloads and OpenClaw responses.
- Document model download time/size and provide a smaller fallback model option.
- Add a simple admin endpoint to inspect recent message history and dispatch errors.
