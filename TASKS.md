# NestorAI — Codex Task Board

## Global rules
- One task = one branch = one PR
- Do not modify docker-compose unless assigned
- All PRs must pass: scripts/check.sh (or explain why not)

## Open questions
- Ports exposed by gateway?
- What is the minimal “happy path” user flow?

## Tasks (initial)
T1 — Establish health + smoke harness
T2 — Add minimal integration tests
T3 — Feature work (TBD)
